<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born in the year of the dragon. Loves to travel with my hubby and kiddos. Missing Wakeboarding so much.</p>

<p>Boarded the ship for 5 years and decided to shift career.</p>

<p>Started as a Amazon product sourcing analyst and after some time became a Amazon Store manager. Now as I chase my new path as a web developer, I look forward to have a more challenging and rewarding hobby.</p>
